#Teleop roboat
This project provides the implementation of a teleoperated robot using ROS (Robot Operating System) and WiFi communication. The project includes scripts for both the robot's subscriber node and the teleoperation publisher node, enabling remote control of the robot's movements.
#Overview
The teleop robot project enables the control of a robot using keyboard inputs over a WiFi connection. The robot can move forward, backward, turn left, turn right, and perform other actions based on the received commands. This is achieved using a ROS node that subscribes to keyboard inputs and translates them into motor control signals.
